Unity Project 
Senior project: Drag and Drop editor to create and play board games
Created and Developed by: -Taylor Ballai -Sung Cho -James Klein -Sativa Maciel

Our project allows its users to Create and Play Board Games through a web-based interface using Unity and WebGL and hosted on Unity Play. These games may include, for example, custom boards, custom assets (such as game pieces), points, and elements of chance. The creation component includes a drag and drop editing system for customizing the board, game pieces, and actions. 

Navigating the site: 

Main Menu: Menu page introduces the user to the site. Two navigation buttons allow the user to choose between the create game editor, or play game.

Create: Navigating to the Create Page allows the user to open up a menu to choose different game components to add to the board, upon adding elements, the user can interact with them.
Instruction text on the screen helps guide the user in using the editor. Two more navigation links after exiting out of the Menu lets the user navigate to the Play scene or Main Menu.

Play: Play scene allows the user to play a simple player vs computer ‘race to the finish’ style game. Player interacts with the dice to roll and take turns moving towards the end of the board. 

End Scene: Just like the Main Menu, there are two navigation links to play again or return to the main menu.
